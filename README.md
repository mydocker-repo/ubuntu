customized ubuntu
This project provides a custom Docker image based on Ubuntu, designed to simulate a minimal VPS environment. It includes an SSH server enabled by default, allowing users to interact with the container just like a typical remote server. This setup is ideal for testing, development, or training purposes where a lightweight and easily reproducible virtual server is needed.
